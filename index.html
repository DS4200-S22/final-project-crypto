    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      The cryptocurrency space has seen exponential growth and cash inflows in recent years. The rapid growth requires investors to be knowledgeable on multiple metrics about multiple assets at any given time. On top of that, significant announcements are made daily, further requiring investors to stay consistently up to date. We streamline the process for these investors by providing them with overall and asset-specific metrics at their fingertips through a single interface. Our approach aims to enable even the most novice investors to make educated financial crypto positions.

      <span class='metric-tool-tip'> Market capitalization (or market cap) is the total dollar value of all the shares of a company’s stock — or, in the case of Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, of all the coins that have been mined. In crypto, market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins that have been mined by the price of a single coin at any given time.
