    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      The cryptocurrency space has seen exponential growth and cash inflows in recent years. The rapid growth requires investors to be knowledgeable on multiple metrics about multiple assets at any given time. On top of that, significant announcements are made daily, further requiring investors to stay consistently up to date. We streamline the process for these investors by providing them with overall and asset-specific metrics at their fingertips through a single interface. Our approach aims to enable even the most novice investors to make educated financial crypto positions.
